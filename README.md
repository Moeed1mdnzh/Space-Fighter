# Space-Fighter

This is a simple game written in python and it took me a week to finish it.
This project was inspired by my idea. I wasn't able to add the music of the game
because git kept giving me some frustrating errors during pushing files.To run the game
You can simply run the "main.py" file.


# Tasks-About

The menu of this game includes 5 options.The first option will start the game.
The second option is difficulty which is the place where you can select the difficulty of the game.In the third
option you can change the theme of your character.
The fourth option is the guide option that there are enough explanations in that part.You can read everything
about this game right there.Also all the images of the game were made by me so feel free to use them for 
your own games but don't forget to give ctto(credit to the owner).
The last option is the quit option.
